# EZHACK
What is the first thing that you do when tasked with pentesting a box? Probably run nmap, then check the versions for vulnerabilities, exploits, etc... And hopefully take over the box. Complicated? Sometimes. Boring? Sometimes. Why not automate this process?

As a student at North Dakota State University pursuing a career in cybersecurity, there is a certain demand for automated hacking. The main reason is that computers can react faster than humans, and in some cases, we really don't care if a human or a computer doing the hacking. For the most basic hacking applications and demonstrations, we end up writing the same commands over and over, with little thinking involved.

Computer programs exist to make our lives less tedious, and that is the goal of this project. In this repo lies a collection of scripts written in Python 3 (the best Python), and these scripts handle the tedious task of running all the most usual commands.
